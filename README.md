- 👋 Hi, I’m @Project-Sebi
-  I’m a Bachelor student of Philosophy at KCL
- 👀 In terms of programming, I'm currently interested in data science and machine learning. I am somewhat comfortable with R and Python I also have experience with Java, but  from a few years back.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning methods specifically: Tree-based methods, Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects and learn ML methods thoroughly.

 Completed Projects:

Causal Inference and Machine Learning for Politics - Module at Humboldt University, programming in R

- First half of the module focused on Causal Inference methods such as Difference-in-Differences, Instrumental Variables, Interaction Effects, Reggression Discontinuity Design.
- Second half of the module focused on Machine Learning methods such as dimension reduction for OLS reggression (Lasso and Ridge Reggressions), Logistic Reggression, Tree-based methods (bagging, boosting, random forests), Support Vector Machines (theory only), Deep Learning (Theory only). 
- PS 1 is an Introduction to Causal Inference framework using 2012 Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation by Gerber and Green, Chapter 1 exercises
- PS 2 is a general introduction to R using https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/
- PS 3 is introduction to R's tidyverse using Chapter 4 of https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ and some exercises from Chapter 2 Gerber Green 2012 
- PS 4 is a completion of exercise from Chaper 7 ie. ggplot() https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ and solving Instrumental Variables problem using AER package for R
- PS 5 is a data cleaning and a simplified replication of 2011 Regression Discontinuity Design paper Incumbency Advantage in Brazil: Evidence from Municipal Mayor Elections by Rocio Titiunik 
- PS 6 is a simplified replication of a 2012 Diff-in-Diff paper Commodity Price Shocks and Civil Conflict: Evidence from Colombia by Dube and Vargas
- PS 7
