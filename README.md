- 👋 Hi, I’m @Project-Sebi
-  I’m a Bachelor student of Philosophy at KCL
- 👀 In terms of programming, I'm currently interested in data science and machine learning. I am somewhat comfortable with R and I have a bit less experience with Java and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning methods specifically: Tree-based methods, Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects.

Completed Projects:
Causal Inference and Machine Learning for Politics - Module at Humboldt University, programming in R
First half of the module focused on Causal Inference methods such as Difference-in-Differences, Instrumental Variables, Interaction Effects, Reggression Discontinuity Design.
Second half of the module focused on Machine Learning methods such as dimension reduction for OLS reggression (Lasso and Ridge Reggressions), Logistic Reggression, Tree-based methods (bagging, boosting, random forests), Support Vector Machines (theory only), Deep Learning (Theory only).
