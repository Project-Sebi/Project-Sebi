- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Project-Sebi
-  I‚Äôm a Bachelor student of Philosophy at KCL
- üëÄ In terms of programming, I'm currently interested in data science and machine learning. I am somewhat comfortable with R and Python I also have experience with Java, but  from a few years back.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Machine Learning methods specifically: Tree-based methods, Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects and learn ML methods thoroughly.
- üì´ How to reach me: stros.seb@gmail.com

 COMPLETED PROJECTS:

Causal Inference and Machine Learning for Politics - Module at Humboldt University, programming in R
Each week one problem set. Problem sets are uploaded here at my github

- First half of the module focused on Causal Inference methods such as Difference-in-Differences, Instrumental Variables, Interaction Effects, Reggression Discontinuity Design.
- Second half of the module focused on Machine Learning methods such as dimension reduction for OLS reggression (Lasso and Ridge Reggressions), Logistic Reggression, Tree-based methods (bagging, boosting, random forests), Support Vector Machines (theory only), Deep Learning (Theory only). 
- PS 1 is an Introduction to Causal Inference framework using 2012 Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation by Gerber and Green, Chapter 1 exercises
- PS 2 is a general introduction to R using https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/
- PS 3 is introduction to R's tidyverse using Chapter 4 of https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ and some exercises from Chapter 2 Gerber Green 2012 
- PS 4 is a completion of exercise from Chaper 7 ie. ggplot() https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ and solving Instrumental Variables problem using AER package for R
- PS 5 is a data cleaning and a simplified replication of 2011 Regression Discontinuity Design paper Incumbency Advantage in Brazil: Evidence from Municipal Mayor Elections by Rocio Titiunik 
- PS 6 is a simplified replication of a 2012 Diff-in-Diff paper Commodity Price Shocks and Civil Conflict: Evidence from Colombia by Dube and Vargas
- PS 7 uses Matching method between similar treated and control subjects
- PS 8 uses interaction effects and Mathing methods

- PS 9 was introduction to Machine Learning (bias, variance, K-nearest neighbors)
- PS 10 was regression and classification
- PS 11 looked at sparse and flexible regressions (lasso, ridge, smoothing by derivation)
- PS 12 was introduction to decision tress
